Once the installation is completed go to 'Settings' tab, look for the module named "Partner NIF" and
activate it. Then request access to the Webservice in 'Request an Access Key' button that will redirect you to the official
website `NIF.PT <https://www.nif.pt/>`_. After requesting the access key you must enter it in the IAP Account
menu and choose which companies will have permissions to use the key.
Upon saving the changes the module will be working correctly.
The free service is limited to 1000 credits per month, 100 credits per day, 10 credits per hour and 1 credit
per minute. However, if you find that the free service doesn't provide enough credits, you can buy extra credits
from the "Buy Credits" button and follow the respective information.
Only credits paid will be shown in the settings tab.
