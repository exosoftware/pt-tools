Once the installation is completed go to 'Settings' tab, look for the module named "ZIP CTT" and
activate it. Then request access to the Webservice in 'Request an Access Key' button that will redirect you to the official
website `cttcodigopostal.pt <https://www.cttcodigopostal.pt/api>`_. After requesting the access key you must enter it in settings.
Upon saving the changes the module will be working correctly.
